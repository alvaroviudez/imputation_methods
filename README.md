How to deal with null/emtpy values

As we learn how to make our Data Science projects as scientific and accurate as possible, different methods and procedures are to be learnt. Quite often, several methods exist to solve the same issue. One of these situations is dealing with null/empty values.

The goal of this experiment is to compare the accurateness of different imputation methods. We'll do so by using a dataset created using Google Sheets where we have related x features and a target variable y. Besides that original dataset, we'll use two additional datasets that resemble the original dataset, but with 20% or 80% empty values.
